# Image_Source_Method_Reverb_Convolution
An implementation of Image source method for generation shoebox-type-room impulse response for the given room dimension.
Each  wall has different absorption coefficient.
The output generated has the dimension mentioned and changes as the parameter changes for room dimension.
